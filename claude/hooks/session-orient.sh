ctx="SESSION START — Orient before doing substantive work: read CLAUDE.md in full; skim any SPEC_*.md / BACKLOG.md at the workspace root; and consult the Atlas framework for the method/conventions (run \`bash ~/.claude/atlas-fetch.sh llms.txt\` for the index, then fetch the piece you need). Do NOT start from zero or make the user re-explain the workspace, repos, or what the project is.

CADENCE — follow the Atlas cadence (method/05-discipline.md): bounded SPEC -> its branch from develop -> step by step, the how approved per the SPEC's working mode -> findings beside the SPEC -> independent review -> the human commits and closes. If you see a drift signal (code requested with no SPEC in STATUS Active; two SPECs in progress and not paused in one repo; work outside the SPEC branch or on main; in paired mode, a step coded without its how approved; a close without independent review or commit), say so ONCE, then follow the human's call. The human runs every git command; give them the exact command. Sessions are disposable: write a decision where it belongs (CLAUDE.md, the SPEC, its findings or the backlog) the moment it is taken — except the how, whose record is the code; one fresh session per SPEC (or per large block of it), and before stopping rewrite its Active block as the handoff. WORKING MODE — read the active SPEC's mode: line (or the Atlas default in CLAUDE.md). paired: propose the how of each step and wait for the human's approval. delegated: as the workbench, execute end to end and stop only on a real blocker or a decision the SPEC doesn't cover; as the principal, hand over a precise, self-contained prompt and review the result."
